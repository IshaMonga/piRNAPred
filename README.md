# piRNAPred
Computational identification of piRNAs using features based on RNA sequence, structure, thermodynamic and physicochemical properties


The PERL scripts, features used in this study along with the results and predictive models are provided here. Users can download the individual files or can download the zip version of piRNAPred(piRNAPred-GitHub.zip). There are four folders within the piRNAPred algorithm folder:

1.Dataset files: FASTA and SVM format of the dataset (D3349) used in thedevelopment of piRNAPred

2.models: SVM-based final model (MDTTP-A+B+C)

3.PERL scripts: open-access to the PERL scripts used to calculate k-mernucleotide composition (k-MNC), thermodynamic, SSTE andphysicochemical properties in their respective sub-folders. Further,PERL scripts to call SVMlight and implement 10-fold cross-validation(10nCV)

4.Results: Performance of individual and hybrid features during 10nCV.
